				<h3>What information are we listening for?</h3>
				<p>If we need to understand a diagram or follow a map, we are usually trying to find out where things are, what something is made of or how it works. We may be listening for places, buildings, names of parts or stages in a process.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>What cues can we use to help get the right answers?</h3>
				<p>Certain words are included to guide you. These may be things like the compass points, left and right, expressions of position and place, verbs, and adjectives of size, shape, quality, etc.</p>
