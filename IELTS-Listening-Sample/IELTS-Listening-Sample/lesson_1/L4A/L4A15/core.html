            	<strong><i>Explanation:</i></strong> In this kind of activity you have to focus on what is in a specific place rather than on where something is. The numbers are on the map or diagram and you will hear them in the logical numerical order. It is unlikely though that the options will be referred to in exactly the same way as they are listed on the page. So you have to think in advance about how the recording might refer to the options. For example, if one of the options refers to ‘biofuels’ you might expect the speaker to use the words ‘petrol’ and ‘diesel’. Similarly, when thinking about how ‘in-car entertainment’ could be paraphrased, you might predict the word ‘music’.
