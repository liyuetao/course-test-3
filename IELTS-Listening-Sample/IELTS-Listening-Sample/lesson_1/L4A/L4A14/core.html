of the most interesting exhibits, so I’d like to give you a bit of general information first. First of all, there is a
small stand to the left of the information desk as you go into the hall. That’s got a very interesting display
looking at different modern technologies allowing you to listen to good quality music as you drive. Next to
that, to the right of the information desk, is a very interesting area where you can see an area devoted to
the development of more ecologically sound forms of petrol and diesel. I think that you will be impressed
by what you see there.</p>

           <i>Explanation:</i> Although ‘function’ and ‘functions’ both appear in the text, in <span>1</span> ‘function’ is wrong because it would make
the sentence ungrammatical. The correct answer is ‘functions’. In <span>3</span> , ‘positive publicity’ is wrong because it would
make the sentence ungrammatical, and ‘positive’ means the same as ‘favourable’. The correct answer is ‘publicity’.
