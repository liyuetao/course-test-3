            	OK, we’re at the south entrance to the mall now. I’ll tell you where some of the main shops are and then you can go off and explore on your own. Can we meet up though at the pizza restaurant at half past twelve? You’ll find that about halfway along this street in front of us now. If you come to the fountain, that means you’ve gone too far. It’s just before that on the left-hand side.
